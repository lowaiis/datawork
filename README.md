An attempt to make a functional then profitable crypto trading bot

# Lowaiis' work

So far the plan is:
//
  1. Create Sqlite3 local 'database' to store data from Poloniex 8/3
  2. Decide which variables are important to crunch as features 
  3. Set up the interaction code between my database and Poloniex ( basically a live ticker for data ) 8/3
  4. Extract data from database and machine learn, save the classifier
  5. create more currency pair databases and save them
  
  NOTES:
  Correlation between bitcoin price/market cap and all other alt coins
  find the volume multiplier for demand shift
  Create the formula for demand 
  learn some fucking matplotlib
