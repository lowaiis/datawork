So far the plan is:

  1. Create Sqlite3 local 'database' to store data from Poloniex
  2. Decide which variables are important to crunch as features 
  3. Set up the interaction code between my database and Poloniex ( basically a live ticker for data )
  4. Extract data from database and machine learn, save the classifier
